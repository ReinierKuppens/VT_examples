# VT_examples
Numerical examples of the solutions of the examples of the paper "Static Balancing of Planar and Spatial Serial Chains with Virtual Transmissions"

Add the folder Plot_functions to your matlab search path by clicking "set path -> Add Folder..." and then navigating tot he appropriate directory.

You can now run "Animate_paper_examples.m" to animate all animations from the paper.

Or

You can now run the functions "Planar_1Link_1DOF.m", "Planar_2Link_1DOF.m", "Planar_2Link_2DOF.m" or  "Planar_3Link_3DOF.m" to generate a random planar statically balanced mechanisms

Or

You can now run the functions "Spatial_1link_1spring.m", "Spatial_1link_2spring.m" or "Spatial_1link_nspring.m" to generate a random spatial statically balanced mechanism
